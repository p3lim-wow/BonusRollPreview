## Description

BonusRollPreview allows you to see at a glance what the possible yields from a bonus roll would be.  
When the bonus roll window shows up, press the arrow button to show a quick preview of items.  
You can also change your spec priority right from the window.

So, from now on you don't have to alt-tab to a browser or open the Encounter Journal while on limited time.

This addon was made based on an idea posted on [reddit](//reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1b79zj/addon_idea_after_you_killed_a_boss_you_will_see_a/).
